- Result of the packt training on react backend and frontend development: a small application where developers can create profiles and post messages and comment on them.
- basically the training, but updated deprecated stuff (e.g. Routes)
- added Terraform deploy to provision a machine in AWS to run the application
- added Chef scripts to run the application.
